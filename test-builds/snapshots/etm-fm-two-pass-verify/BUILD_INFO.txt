Build: ETM FM two-pass verification
Date: 2026-02-22
Tool: PlatformIO (ats-mini-s3 env)

Changes:
- FM Thorough: two-pass scan — coarse (30 ms, permissive threshold) then verify (100 ms, full RSQ).
- Verify pass fills FREQOFF, PILOT, MULT per candidate; Finalize uses cluster scoring.
- Clear winner by score committed; when FREQOFF/PILOT don't discriminate, keep both in cluster.
- AM coarse unchanged (user sensitivity); no verify for AM.
- New phase VerifyScan; new radio_service::readFullRsqFm() for RSQ.

Artifacts: firmware.bin, firmware.elf, firmware.map
